# APC AP9606
The APC AP9606 is a very old NMC for the Smart-UPS line. They go for under $10 each on ebay and are great for use on an isolated VLAN for SNMP alerts and actions. Their network interface is only 10BaseT, but that is a non-issue for the purpose they serve and they work without issue on most gigabit switches.

## Discover/Reset IP Address
1. Connect to the same layer 2 network as a PC.
1. Use Wireshark and filter for: `eth.src[0:3]==00:c0:b7`
1. Reset the AP9606 (hold reset button for 2-3 seconds)
    - After about 30 seconds, you will see the AP9606 doing ARP lookups.
1. Put your computer in the same IP range and login (apc/apc).
1. Go to `System | Tools | Action | Reset to Defaults except TCP/IP`
    - This is to clear any custom settings someone else may have had.
1. After the card reboots (~30 seconds), log back in and set your own IP settings.

## Upgrade firmware
1. Download latest available firmwares (FTP Search Engines are your friend here).
